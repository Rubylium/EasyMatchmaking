Matchmaking System for Game Modes (Theoretical Implementation)

This repository contains a theoretical Lua-based matchmaking system designed for FiveM servers, focusing on creating balanced matches and managing player queues for various game modes. This code is not intended to work as-is but serves as a logical framework for implementing a matchmaking system.
Overview

The theoretical matchmaking system is implemented as a Matchmaking class in the matchmaking.lua file. The class provides methods for creating and managing parties, estimating wait times, adding players to queues, and creating matches with balanced teams based on player skills.

The system supports multiple game modes, and it can be easily extended to include additional modes. Currently, it supports the following game modes:

    Deathmatch
    Capture the Flag
    Team Deathmatch

Note: This code is not intended for direct use and may require modifications to fit specific implementations or integrate with other systems. It serves as a theoretical framework for designing a matchmaking system.

For more details on the system components, methods, custom events, and extending the system, please refer to the technical README.
